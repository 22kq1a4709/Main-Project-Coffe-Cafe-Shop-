        <h1>Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. It was here where Starbucks opened its first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices from around the world for our customers to take home. Our name was inspired by the classic tale, “Moby-Dick,” evoking the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.</h1>
         <h1>Behind every cup of coffee is a story. Enjoy some of our favorites along with all the latest news from the storytellers at Starbucks Stories.</p>

        <h1>Ethiopia is considered to be the birthplace of the coffee plant and of coffee culture. It is thought that coffee was discovered in Ethiopia as long ago as the ninth century. Today, over 12 million people in Ethiopia are involved in the cultivation and picking of coffee, and coffee remains a central part of Ethiopian culture.</h1>
        <h1>The Ethiopian coffee ceremony is central to the communities of many Ethiopian villages.</p>

        <h1>Coffee is rich in many of the nutrients naturally found in coffee beans.

            A typical 8-ounce (240-ml) cup of coffee contains (1):
            
            Vitamin B2 (riboflavin): 11% of
            the DV
            Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid): 6% of
            the DV
            Vitamin B1 (thiamine): 2% of
            the DV
            Vitamin B3 (niacin): 2% of
            the DV
            Folate: 1% of the DV
            Manganese: 3% of the DV
            Potassium: 3% of the DV
            Magnesium: 2% of the DV
            Phosphorus: 1% of the DV
            This may not seem like a lot, but try multiplying it with the number of cups you drink per day — it can add up to a significant portion of your daily nutrient intake.
            
            But coffee really shines in its high content of antioxidants.</h1>

        <h1>Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of green coffee beans into roasted coffee products. The roasting process is what produces the characteristic flavor of coffee by causing the green coffee beans to change in taste. Unroasted beans contain similar if not higher levels of acids, protein, sugars, and caffeine as those that have been roasted, but lack the taste of roasted coffee beans due to the Maillard and other chemical reactions that occur during roasting.</h1>
